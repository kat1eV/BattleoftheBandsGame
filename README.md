 **REFLECTION**

 I was sincerely nervous about this final project as i definitley struggled with homework assignments in this class and wish i was able to take more advantage of the resubmit policy, but I was often too busy with the projects due that week. I'm actually really proud of this project!!! I feel like allowing myself to be creative really made me passionate and motivated on this project. I cannot believe that in the matter of three weeks i was able to learn how to add audio, use slowprint and practice using while loops!!!!

 If i had unlimited time i definitley wouldve made this game into its original idea, which was a text based battle game between bands where they would use their instruments as weapons and attack opposing bands. This wouldve been really fun but i think having this as my original idea was biting off more than i could chew, being that i worked on this project alone (other than office hours help and internet resources for how to use audio and implement slow print)
